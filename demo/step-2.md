# Step 2: Designing the Likes API Specification

After refining our plan in Step 1, we now need to design the OpenAPI specification for the new "Likes" resource, focusing solely on the API contract without implementation details.

## Review Current Plan

- We've reviewed the plan in [Active Context](../memory-bank/activeContext.md) and confirmed our approach
- The plan now correctly focuses on the OpenAPI specification only, with implementation being out of scope

## Chunking the Task

***Task Decomposition*** - By chunking the task, the model receives critical hints that transform the initially vague request, "Define the OpenAPI specification for the 'likes' endpoint," into a concrete series of steps, resulting in a smaller, more manageable scope.

We see in the active context that these steps are now very clearly defined:

```yaml
3.  Create/update the necessary OpenAPI partial files (e.g., new schemas in `openapi/shared/schemas/` or `openapi/v1/schemas/`, new paths in `openapi/v1/paths/`).
4.  Update `openapi/openapi.yaml` to reference the new "likes" paths and schemas.
5.  Run `make generate-types` (or at least the `redocly bundle` part) to create an updated `openapi/openapi-bundled.yaml`.
```

***Providing Specific Context*** - By providing specific details about the file structure and build process, the model can automatically understand the necessary steps without requiring additional clarification.

## Defining the Data Model

Now that the model knows how to proceed, we need to define what to create. Switch back to PLAN mode and provide a concrete data model to constrain the AI's response:

> Prompt (PLAN):
> 
> I would like the likes endpoint to follow the current REST conventions of the project. The Likes data model should have the following shape:
> 
> ```go
> // Like represents a user's like on a post or comment.
> type Like struct {
> 	ID        string    `json:"id"`         // Unique identifier for the like
> 	UserID    string    `json:"user_id"`    // ID of the user who liked the content
> 	PostID    *string   `json:"post_id,omitempty"`   // ID of the post being liked (nullable)
> 	CommentID *string   `json:"comment_id,omitempty"` // ID of the comment being liked (nullable)
> 	CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"` // Timestamp when the like was created
> }
> ```
> 
> PostID and CommentID are made nullable (using pointers in Go, *string) because a single Like entry represents a user liking either a post or a comment, but not both simultaneously.
> 
> Generate an initial spec that we can discuss and iterate together
> // Expected output: OpenAPI schema definition for the Like resource

## Review Implementation

- After receiving the initial specification, we switch to ACT mode to update the memory bank, ensuring the design decisions are preserved across contexts.

> Prompt (ACT):
> 
> Can we add this plan to the memory bank so that I can review it across contexts to make sure we are making the right decisions?
