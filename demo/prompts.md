# Problem Statement

We have some bugs in the UI on the Signup Form and we want to build a new page from scratch once the bugs have been fixed.

## Prompts 

### Initialize memory bank

### Triage and Troubleshooting

- prompt:
```
(PLAN)
Currently, trying to signup as a new user on the Frontend at the /signup page produces a 400 errors from the BE:

\```
{errors: [{code: "GOSOCIAL-001-BAD_REQUEST", message: "json: unknown field "first_name""}]}
errors
: 
[{code: "GOSOCIAL-001-BAD_REQUEST", message: "json: unknown field "first_name""}]
0
: 
{code: "GOSOCIAL-001-BAD_REQUEST", message: "json: unknown field "first_name""}
code
: 
"GOSOCIAL-001-BAD_REQUEST"
message
: 
"json: unknown field \"first_name\""
\```

Could you assess and provides hypothesis as to what might be causing this error? As you progress your research, remember to update the memory bank with your improved understanding of the project and the system.

Provide me your hypothetis and a potential plan to fix the issue with the minimal amount of changes.
```


- Cline response:

```
Okay, I understand the issue. A 400 error with the message json: unknown field "first_name" strongly suggests a mismatch between the JSON payload the frontend is sending for user signup and the structure the Go backend expects. The Go backend's JSON unmarshaler cannot find a corresponding field in its target struct for the first_name key it received in the JSON.

Here's my hypothesis and a plan to investigate and fix this:

Hypothesis:

Frontend Sending Incorrect Field Name: The frontend (SignupPage.tsx and/or authService.ts) is sending a field literally named first_name in the JSON request body.
Backend Expecting Different Field Name (or no such field):
The Go struct used in the signup handler (cmd/api/auth_handlers.go) to unmarshal the request body either doesn't have a field intended for "first name", OR
It has a field for "first name", but its JSON tag is different (e.g., json:"firstName", json:"FirstName", or it's part of a nested struct). The Go JSON unmarshaler is case-sensitive and relies on these tags.
OpenAPI Specification Mismatch: The openapi.yaml (and its referenced schemas like openapi/v1/schemas/user.yaml or auth.yaml) might define the user creation payload differently than what the frontend is sending or what the backend is expecting. This could lead to discrepancies if code generation was used or if manual implementation diverged from the spec.
Plan to Investigate and Fix (with Minimal Changes):

My primary goal will be to align the frontend and backend, ideally by adhering to the OpenAPI specification as the source of truth.

Phase 1: Information Gathering & Memory Bank Update (I'll do this first)

Read Memory Bank: I'll start by re-reading all files in the memory-bank/ directory to refresh my context on the project's structure, technologies, and patterns. This is essential for me.
memory-bank/projectbrief.md
memory-bank/productContext.md
memory-bank/techContext.md
memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
memory-bank/activeContext.md
memory-bank/progress.md
Phase 2: Investigation (I'll describe the steps I'd take in ACT mode)

Examine Frontend Code:

frontend/src/pages/SignupPage.tsx: I'll check the form input field names and how the form data is collected.
frontend/src/services/authService.ts: I'll inspect the signup function to see exactly how the request payload object is constructed before being sent to the backend. I'll look for the first_name key.
frontend/src/generated/api-types.ts: I'll look for the TypeScript type definition related to the signup request payload. This type is likely generated from the OpenAPI spec and will tell us what the frontend thinks it should be sending.
Examine Backend Code:

cmd/api/auth_handlers.go: I'll find the signup handler function. Inside this function, I'll identify the Go struct type into which the JSON request body is unmarshaled.
internal/domain/user_model.go or internal/generated/types.go (or similar): I'll examine the definition of this Go struct, paying close attention to field names and their json:"..." tags. This will tell us what the backend expects. For example, it might be expecting json:"firstName" or not have a first name field at all in that specific struct.
Examine OpenAPI Specification (The Source of Truth):

openapi/openapi.yaml: I'll navigate to the path definition for the user signup endpoint (e.g., /users, /auth/signup).
openapi/v1/schemas/user.yaml or openapi/v1/schemas/auth.yaml: I'll check the request body schema definition for this endpoint. This will show the expected properties, their names (e.g., firstName or first_name), and types.
Phase 3: Propose Solution (Based on Investigation Findings)

The "minimal change" solution depends on the findings:

Scenario A: Frontend is sending first_name, Backend expects firstName (and OpenAPI agrees with firstName).

Fix: Modify the frontend (authService.ts) to send firstName instead of first_name.
Reasoning: Align frontend to the established contract (OpenAPI and backend).
Scenario B: Frontend is sending first_name, Backend doesn't expect a first name field at all for signup (and OpenAPI reflects this).

Fix: Modify the frontend (authService.ts) to remove the first_name field from the payload.
Reasoning: Frontend is sending superfluous data.
Scenario C: Frontend is sending first_name, Backend expects first_name but its Go struct tag is missing or incorrect (e.g., no tag, or json:"FirstName"). OpenAPI specifies first_name.

Fix: Modify the Go struct in the backend to correctly include json:"first_name" for the relevant field.
Reasoning: Backend implementation detail is incorrect according to the contract.
Scenario D: OpenAPI is ambiguous or incorrect, leading to a mismatch between generated types or manual implementations.

Fix:
Correct the openapi.yaml to definitively use one convention (e.g., firstName or first_name).
Re-run code generation scripts for both frontend types and backend types/stubs (if applicable).
Adjust frontend and/or backend code to align with the newly generated types.
Reasoning: Fix the contract first, then propagate changes. This might be more than a "minimal" code change but is the most robust solution.
Phase 4: Update Memory Bank

Throughout and after the investigation and fix, I will update the relevant Memory Bank files (activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md) with new learnings about:

The exact structure of the signup payload.
Confirmed JSON field naming conventions (e.g., camelCase vs. snake_case).
The reliability of the OpenAPI spec and code generation process.
Any discrepancies found and the reasons for them.
Next Steps:

First, I need to perform Phase 1 (Read Memory Bank). Since I'm in PLAN MODE, I can't use tools like read_file directly.

Could you please confirm if you'd like me to proceed with this general plan? If so, once I've mentally processed the Memory Bank (which I'll simulate by stating I've done so), I can then detail the specific files I'd want to examine. After that, you can switch me to ACT MODE to perform the file reading and subsequent steps.


The error json: unknown field "first_name" indicates a mismatch between the JSON payload sent by the frontend during signup and what the Go backend expects.

My Hypothesis:
The frontend is likely sending a first_name field, but the backend Go struct for unmarshaling the signup request either:

Doesn't have a field for a first name.
Has a field for a first name, but its json tag is different (e.g., json:"firstName").
The OpenAPI specification, which should be the source of truth, might be inconsistent with either the frontend's payload or the backend's expectation.
My Plan:

1. Refresh Context (Internal Step for me):
I will begin by thoroughly reviewing all existing Memory Bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, techContext.md, systemPatterns.md, activeContext.md, progress.md) to ensure I have the latest project understanding.

2. Investigate (What I'll do in ACT mode):

Frontend Check:
Examine frontend/src/pages/SignupPage.tsx (form data structure).
Examine frontend/src/services/authService.ts (payload construction in the signup function).
Examine frontend/src/generated/api-types.ts (the expected frontend request type).
Backend Check:
Examine cmd/api/auth_handlers.go (the signup handler and the Go struct used for unmarshaling).
Examine internal/domain/user_model.go or internal/generated/types.go (the definition of the user/signup Go struct and its JSON tags).
Contract Check (OpenAPI):
Examine openapi/openapi.yaml and relevant schema files (e.g., openapi/v1/schemas/user.yaml or auth.yaml) for the signup endpoint's request body definition.
3. Implement Fix (in ACT mode, based on findings):
The goal is minimal changes, likely by:
*   Adjusting the field name in the frontend payload (authService.ts).
*   Or, adjusting the JSON tag in the backend Go struct.
*   Or, if the OpenAPI spec is the source of the issue, updating it, regenerating types, and then aligning the code.

4. Update Memory Bank (in ACT mode):
I will document my findings, the fix applied, and any new insights about the system (e.g., confirmed naming conventions, API structure) in activeContext.md and other relevant memory bank files.

Do you agree with this investigation and resolution plan? If so, please let me know, and then you can switch me to ACT MODE so I can begin reading the Memory Bank files and then the project files.
```

- prompt:

```
(ACT)
Begin with Phase 1 and Phase 2 - You should update the memory bank with any relevant information - and come back to me with a technical plan. You should not begin any implementation of this plan until explicitly told so.
```

### Agentic mode to update memory bank and technical plan

*Cline start Agentic mode updating the memory bank and start iterating over multiple files to perform its investigation*

- Summary of Cline findings:

```markdown
The investigation into the 400 error (`json: unknown field "first_name"`) on the `/v1/auth/signup` endpoint is complete, and the Memory Bank has been updated with the findings.

__Summary of Findings:__

1. __Frontend (`SignupPage.tsx`, `generated/api-types.ts`):__ Correctly sends a __flat__ JSON payload with snake\_case keys (e.g., `{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", ...}`). This aligns with the types generated from the OpenAPI specification.
2. __OpenAPI Specification (`openapi/v1/paths/auth.yaml`):__ Correctly defines the request body for the signup endpoint as a __flat__ schema (`SignupRequest`), which directly contains fields like `first_name`.
3. __Backend Handler (`cmd/api/auth_handlers.go`):__ Incorrectly expects the signup payload to be __nested__ under a `"data"` key (e.g., `{"data": {"first_name": "...", ...}}`). It attempts to unmarshal the request into a struct like `var requestBody struct { Data *domain.CreateUserDTO `json:"data"` }`.
4. __Backend DTO (`internal/domain/user_model.go`):__ The `domain.CreateUserDTO` struct (which the handler expects inside the `data` wrapper) correctly uses `json:"first_name"` (snake\_case) for its fields. This part is consistent.

__Root Cause:__ The error occurs because the backend `signupHandler` tries to unmarshal the flat payload (sent by the frontend) into a struct that expects a top-level `data` field. Since `first_name` is at the top level of the incoming flat payload, and the handler's initial target struct only has a `data` field, `first_name` is considered an "unknown field" for that initial target struct.

__Technical Plan to Fix the Issue:__

The most straightforward and correct way to fix this is to align the backend handler with the OpenAPI specification, which serves as the contract.

__Proposed Change:__

Modify the `signupHandler` in `cmd/api/auth_handlers.go` to expect a flat payload, matching the OpenAPI specification and the frontend implementation.

__Specific Change in `cmd/api/auth_handlers.go`:__

```


### Investigate hypothesis further

- prompt:

```
(ACT)
Our Go Backend should have structured response when it comes to API contracts. This means we should always provide success responses in the shape of `{ data: {} }` and errors as `{ errors: [] }`.

I see this pattern is reflect in @/openapi/v1/paths/post.yaml  and @/openapi/v1/paths/user.yaml  - but your proposed plam seems to go directly against this project convention.

I want you to review your findings again - in light of the context I just added - and verify whether you think your plan remains the same - or should be changed to a different approach that doesn't violate the conventions of this project.

Your immediate goal is to update the memory bank with a revised or confirmed plan and ask my feedback again before any implementation
```

### Refine plan

Cline confirmed its original plan but we believe that is based on an incorrect assumption due to a mistake we have made in the OpenAPI spec.

```
(ACT)
What if I want to enforce a consistent structure for request and responses? I want the `{ data: <data> }` and `{ errors: [] }` to apply consistently to all endpoint. It shouldn't directly be part of the data schema, but of the path response.

Your immediate goal is to update the memory bank with a revised or confirmed plan and ask my feedback again before any implementation
```

### Review and refine - iterative feedback loop

- prompt:
  
```
(ACT)
I want to apply consistently this pattern, and I don't want to create intermediate schema like "WrappedCreateResponse" - I prefer you define inline in the spec the "data" field and in there you link to the existing data model.

I want you to generate a new plan where we aim to achieve the following:

1. Update signup endpoint to support structured response for success and error
2.Update the Go endpoints and any failing tests. If no tests are failing - it means we are missing a test to validate the shaope of the response, and we need to add it.
1. A revised plan on how to rollout this approach to all other endpoints who are not implementing it yet.

 Your immediate goal is to update the memory bank with a revised or confirmed plan and ask my feedback again before any implementation
```

### Technique: Chunking - instruct task breakdown

- Prompt:

```
(ACT)
Part A seems a good approach but I want to chunk it down to smaller parts we can iterate together. For example I want to first update the schema, then run the backend tests, verify/correct fixes.

Once we have a successful BE implementation - we'll get feedback and discuss how to progress to next step (implement frontend). 

Update your memory bank to chunk your plan into smaller steps.
```

### Begin technical implementation

- Prompt:

```
(ACT)

Begin implementation of Chunk A.1

Continue updating the memory bank as you make progress or make new discovery. Come back to me for feedback at the completion of A.1.
```

- follow up from implementation - model didn't run test or re-generate types

```
(ACT)

Your approach is correct but you failed two important quality verification. If you make changes to the Backend, you should run `make test`. If you make changes to the API spec, you should re-generate the types with `make generate-types`.

Make sure you save this context for future reference when performing such tasks.
```

### Completion of Chunk A.1 - follow up with A.2

```
(ACT)

Begin implementation of Chunk A.2

Continue updating the memory bank as you make progress or make new discovery. Come back to me for feedback at the completion of A.2.

```

Note: this started a long agentic session for a context of 1.3m - which required starting a new task with `/newtask` to preserve task context after 1m Gemini 2.5 pro context was completely filled.

### A.2. is completed - update context

```
(ACT)

Let's update our memory bank with the current state of progress
```

### Begin A.3.

```
(ACT)

Let's proceed with Chunk A.3
```

### Confirm completion of A.3. and review next chunks

```
(ACT)

I confirmed the feature now works. I can complete the signup form. Update the memory and let's discuss what are the next chunks.
```


### Progress onto next chunk

```
(ACT)

Let's tckle the Backend Test Ehnancement and the Rollout Conventions (Part B). I believe Rollout convention should take precedence as it could impact the outcome of the tests. Let's start with that, then run test to ensure a working state, and then move on to Test Enhancements.
```

### Let's have a checkpoint - we want to rollout the pattern we have been working on, to the rest of the codebase

```
(ACT)

The structured response is progressing well. We now want to review all endpoints implementation, and api spec, to ensure this convention is followed everything. 
If we find a path that doesn't not adhere to that, we will refactor and ensure we have a test to verify the new response structure.
```

```
(ACT)

Continue rolli
```


### Create a new feature - Home feed

```
(PLAN)

Let's now build the Home Page - I want you to create a plan that consist of the following:

- Design a new Home Page feed using the available APIs.
- The home feed is only accessible if a user is logged in
- If a user is not logged in - we should redirect to signup/login
- In the Signup form - we should add a button link to Login - in case someone has already an account but is not logged in.

- Create a mockup using the markdown of how the layout of the home page would look like.
- Create a skatch of the user flows in the Home feed, what actions can they perform? What components will be displayed?

The outcome should be a plan that we can review and eventually commit to the memory bank
```

Because this is a large requirement - I do a few iterations in PLAN mode before committing to memory-bank to avoid wasting time on file editing for things that might be incorrect.


```
Commit this plan into the memory bank - so that we can do review and iteration using those files.
```

```
You have a wrong understanding of `react-router` the `react-router-dom` is not required anymore and you will find all exports in `react-router` alredy. Update this information in your memory bank
```


### Revert mistakes from the model

```
(ACT)

You have made a mistake in your previous implemention. First of all, you jumped to implementation without requesting my feedback or input. Secondly, you have re-implemented in `App.tsx` the router implementation, which already existed in `main.tsx`.

Revert all changes of your previous iteration, save the relevant additional context in the bank, and recap what is your implementation plan for the next steps.
```

### Resume after correction

```
(ACT)

Now that we have corrected mistakes and updated the memory, let's resume and tackle the next chunk of our plan. 
```

### Ehnance feature

```
(ACT)

We need the same link strategy applied to the Signup form, in the Login form (if someone doesn't have an account, we need a link to send them to signup form)
```

### Fix bug in Login form

```

(ACT)

I have a bug in the Login Form. I add my credentials and click "Login" - I can see in the network tab the login request completes successfully with a 200 - and a token is returned - but I am not redirected to the home page after that.
```
