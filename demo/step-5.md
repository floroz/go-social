# Step 5: Executing the Implementation Plan

## Transitioning to Action

We have now toggled ACT mode on the final plan. All clarifications have been answered, and we are happy with the plan outlined in [activeContext.md](../memory-bank/activeContext.md).

## Leveraging Agentic Capabilities

***Autonomous Execution*** - This is now the start of Agentic mode - Cline will begin running commands and updating files without requiring step-by-step guidance for each action.

Impressively, the system not only generated the necessary types but also automatically updated the API specification by utilizing CLI tooling. This process ensured the auto-generation and updating of existing types. *(Check Git Dff updates)*

***Tool Detection and Usage*** - The model automatically detected which CLI commands to run based on the project context, demonstrating its ability to understand development workflows without explicit instructions.

## Feedback Loop Implementation

***Self-Correction Mechanism*** - The model will feed back to itself any errors in types generation and continue to iterate over the specification until it meets all requirements.

***Continuous Memory Updates*** - I will be assisting with the prompting to continuously update the memory bank for every discovery, ensuring that important context is preserved throughout the implementation process.

**Assist in Debugging** - Provide feedback to the model when errors are encountered, and help debug issues by providing context and guidance.
