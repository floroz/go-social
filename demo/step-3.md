# Step 3: Refining the API Specification

After designing the initial specification for the "Likes" endpoint, we need to address some inconsistencies and ambiguities before finalizing the OpenAPI specification.

## Review of Initial Specification

We now have a fully developed specification in [activeContext.md](../memory-bank/activeContext.md), but the model has identified several important considerations that need clarification.

## Identifying Inconsistencies

***Proactive Validation*** - The model identified potential inconsistencies between our provided example and existing codebase patterns, demonstrating how AI can help detect issues early in the design process.

```markdown
**Discussion Points for this Proposal:**
1.  **ID Types:** Confirm if `Like` related IDs (`id`, `user_id`, `post_id`, `comment_id`) should be `string` (as per Go struct) or `integer` (like other entities).
2.  **Listing Likes Content:** Is an array of full `Like` objects suitable for `GET` requests, or would a list of user IDs/count be preferred in some cases?
3.  **Common Error Responses:** Ensure `#/components/responses/*` refs point to correctly defined shared responses.
```

This highlights the importance of planning and review before implementation, as the model detected a practice violation in an example provided to it.

## Providing Clarification

***Structured Feedback*** - By addressing each point directly and providing clear guidance, we help the model make informed decisions that align with existing patterns and best practices.

> Feedback:
> 1. Stick to integer for consistency - these are PSQL auto-incrementing integers
> 2. Let's have an array of likes as object.
> 3. You should use the existing schema. If an existing schema doesn't exist, we should introduce one that is backwards compatible with the existing specs.

***Point-by-Point Addressing*** - By responding to each numbered point in the model's questions with corresponding numbered answers, we create a clear mapping between questions and answers that minimizes ambiguity.
