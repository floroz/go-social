# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project, "Go Social," aims to create a social media platform. The primary motivation is to provide a space for users to connect, share content, and interact with each other. It serves as a practical application to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities, incorporating backend APIs, a frontend interface, and database management.

## Problems It Solves

- **Need for Connection:** Facilitates social interaction and community building.
- **Content Sharing:** Allows users to share their thoughts, experiences, and media.
- **Information Dissemination:** Can serve as a platform for users to discover and share information.

## How It Should Work

- **User Registration & Login:** Secure and straightforward process for users to create accounts and access the platform.
- **Post Creation & Management:** Users can create, view, edit (if applicable), and delete their own posts.
- **Commenting:** Users can comment on posts, fostering discussion and interaction.
- **Feed/Timeline:** Users should be able to see a collection of posts, potentially from users they follow or a general feed. (Further definition needed)
- **User Profiles:** Basic user profiles displaying their posts and information. (Further definition needed)

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive Interface:** The platform should be easy to navigate and use, even for non-technical users.
- **Responsive Design:** The application should work well on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Performance:** Fast loading times and smooth interactions are crucial for a good user experience.
- **Security:** User data and interactions should be handled securely.
