# Product Context

## Problem Solved

- Provides a platform for social interaction, allowing users to share content (posts) and engage in discussions (comments).
- Addresses the need for a structured and maintainable API by using OpenAPI specifications, ensuring consistency between backend and frontend.

## How it Works

- The system consists of a Go backend and a React frontend.
- The backend exposes a RESTful API defined by an OpenAPI specification.
- Users can create accounts, log in, create posts, and comment on posts.
- The frontend interacts with the backend API to display information and allow user actions.
- API responses follow a consistent structure: `data` key for success, `errors` key for failures.
- Code generation tools (`oapi-codegen` for Go, `openapi-typescript` for TS) are used to create types from the OpenAPI spec.
- Facade patterns are used in both backend and frontend to decouple application code from generated types.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide an intuitive and responsive interface for social interactions.
- Ensure clear feedback to users for actions (e.g., successful post creation, login errors).
- Maintain API stability for current and future client applications through versioning.
- Offer interactive API documentation via Swagger UI for developers.
