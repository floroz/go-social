# Progress

## What Works

- Core application structure (Go backend, React frontend).
- User authentication (signup, login, logout, token refresh).
- Post creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
- Comment creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion on posts.
- Database setup with PostgreSQL and migrations using golang-migrate.
- API definition using OpenAPI, with code generation for Go and TypeScript types.
- Development environment setup with Docker, Makefiles for common tasks.
- Frontend setup with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, Zustand, React Query.
- Basic testing setup for backend and frontend.
- Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI.

## What's Left to Build

- **Future Features (Post-Spec Definition):**
    - Implement backend logic for "likes" (database tables, repositories, services, handlers).
    - Implement frontend UI and logic for "likes" (components, API calls, state management).
- **Technical Improvements/Future Considerations:**
    - Strategy for producing and persisting different OpenAPI bundle snapshots over time.
    - Potentially more comprehensive testing.
    - Further UI/UX enhancements on the frontend.
    - Scalability and performance optimizations as the user base grows.

## Current Status

- The OpenAPI specification for the "likes" feature has been successfully defined and verified in Swagger UI.
    - `openapi/v1/schemas/like.yaml` created.
    - `openapi/v1/paths/like.yaml` created and corrected.
    - `openapi/openapi.yaml` updated with new tags and references.
    - `make generate-types` successfully bundled the spec and generated types.
- The Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) has been updated to reflect the completion of this task.
- The next steps involve the actual implementation of the "likes" feature in the backend and frontend, which is out of scope for the current task.

## Known Issues

- The "missing feature" of OpenAPI bundle snapshotting (longer-term).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Decision:** Adopt OpenAPI for API design to ensure consistency and enable code generation.
- **Initial Decision:** Structure the project with a Go backend and React frontend.
- **Initial Decision:** Use PostgreSQL as the database.
- **Initial Decision:** Implement API versioning from the start (e.g., `/v1/`).
- **Current State:** The project has followed these initial decisions and established a solid foundation. The focus is now shifting towards adding new features like "likes" and considering longer-term improvements like OpenAPI snapshot management.
